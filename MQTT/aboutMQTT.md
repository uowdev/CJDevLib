# MQTT
```
MQTT is a Client Server publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol. It is light weight, open, simple, and designed so as to be easy to implement. These characteristics make it ideal for use in many situations, including constrained environments such as for communication in Machine to Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) contexts where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.

MQTT operates on a "Publish" / "Subscribe" principle

 1. Subject Based Filtering: I want to receive messages from a specific topic
 2. Quality of Service (QoS) levels to ensure all messages get successfully delivered from client to broker and broker to Client
