Docker is for running applications in an isolated environment. Its advantages are similar to that in a VM.

a) Remove "It worked on my computer"
b) Sandbox projects
c) Sharing projects is easier

Lighter than a VM, uses containers which contains only the essentials of a system.
Essentially- enabling a VM without a kernel or the associated library.

Docker uses special features of UNIX to use any Linux machines kernel.

Container- A running instance of an image. >
Image- Template for the snapshot environment >
Docker File- A list of steps to perform to create an image

hub.docker contains many example docker images to simplify the setup process

Volumes: Allows for sharing files between local files and docker files. This  is enabled by using -v in the run command and specifying a folder.
